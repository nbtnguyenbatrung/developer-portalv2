## Overview

NAPAS provides an Open Banking solution based on a centralized connection model, acting as a trusted bridge between data-holding organizations (DPs) such as banks, e-wallets, credit institutions and third parties (TPPs). 

Through this secure infrastructure, TPPs can access account information with user consent, thereby developing personalized value-added services.

The solution is built on international experience and practical needs in Vietnam, aiming at an open, scalable and highly compatible financial data sharing platform, while ensuring full compliance with regulations on security, data sharing and privacy. 

NAPAS issues a set of unified technical, legal and operational standards, helping to simplify integration, increase interoperability and promote flexible deployment of new services.
